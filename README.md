# Neural-recording-project

This is the repo for the Neural recording course (338536) offered by the BioMed School of Technion

The project task is to simulate an experiment involving invasive brain recordings.I have simulated a mouse navigating a T-maze where the mouse 2is modelled as a DQN agent and the TD error encodes the dopamine spikes that drive decision making.The goal is to see how the increased task complexity affects the spikes .Its part of a project to verifyif the heterogenity of the dopamine system helps us in decision making in complex tasks
